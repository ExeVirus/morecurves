## Installation

### Download the mod

To install More Curves, clone this Git repository into your Luanti's `mods/`
directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/exevirus/morecurves.git
```

You can also
[download a ZIP archive](https://github.com/ExeVirus/morecurves/releases)
of More Curves.

### Enable the mod

Once you have installed More Curves, you need to enable it in Luanti.
The procedure is as follows:

#### Using the client's main menu

This is the easiest way to enable More Curves when playing in singleplayer
(or on a server hosted from a client).

1. Start Luanti and switch to the **Local Game** tab.
2. Select the world you want to enable More Curves in.
3. Click **Configure**, then enable `morecurves` by double-clicking it
   (or ticking the **Enabled** checkbox).
4. Save the changes, then start a game on the world you enabled More Curves on.
5. More Curves should now be running on your world.

#### Using a text editor

This is the recommended way to enable the mod on a server without using a GUI.

1. Make sure Luanti is not currently running (otherwise, it will overwrite
   the changes when exiting).
2. Open the world's `world.mt` file using a text editor.
3. Add the following line at the end of the file:

```text
load_mod_morecurves = true
```

If the line is already present in the file, then replace `false` with `true`
on that line.

4. Save the file, then start a game on the world you enabled More Curves on.
5. More Curves should now be running on your world.

## Version compatibility

More Curves is currently primarily tested with Minetest 5.7.0.
It may or may not work with newer or older versions. Issues arising in older
versions than 5.0.0 will generally not be fixed.
